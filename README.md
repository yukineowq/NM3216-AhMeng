## ✏️ About 
Ah Meng is a 2D single-player action-adventure platformer. The player controls Ah Meng as she makes her escape out of the science laboratory and seeks vengeance on her captor, the CEO. She progressively gains different abilities such as enhanced movement, jumping ability and invisibility to navigate collapsing platforms and enemies. Difficulty is increased in each level as platforms collapse more easily and enemies grow in strength and number. 
The game ends when Ah Meng successfully completes Level 5 or meets her end at the hands of the various enemies. Game is appealing to players who enjoy challenging platform-adventure games.
