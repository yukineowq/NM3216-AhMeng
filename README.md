## ✏️ About 
Ah Meng is a 2D single-player action-adventure platformer. The player controls Ah Meng as she makes her escape out of the science laboratory and seeks vengeance on her captor, the CEO. She progressively gains different abilities such as enhanced movement speed, jumping ability and invincibility to navigate collapsing platforms and enemies. Difficulty is increased in each level as platforms collapse more easily and enemies grow in strength and number. The game ends when Ah Meng successfully completes Level 5 or meets her end at the hands of the various enemies. Game is appealing to players who enjoy challenging platform-adventure games.

_This project is part of the module NM3216: Game Design, where students are tasked to create 2D game of any genre using Gamemaker Studio 2._
